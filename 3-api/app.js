// Limit requests from same API

// In here we can define how many requests per IP we are going to allow in a certain amount of time

// Body parser, reading data from body into req.body
// This express.json is middleware. And middleware is basically a function that can modify the incoming request data. It's called middleware bc it stands between, so in the middle of the request and the response. It's a step that the request goes through while it's being processed. (In this exemple the step the request goes through is simply that the data from the body is added to it, i.e. to the request object, by using this middleware. We need app.use to use this middle middleware)

//   console.log('Hello from the middleware!');

//We implement a route handler We could use get but we want to handle all the routes (all the url's) for all the verbs(get, post, delete, patch..). To do that we use app.all() and we pass the star * bc we want all the url's
// NOTE: we have to put it after calling (i.e mounting) the routers
app.all('*', (req, res, next) => {
  // res.status(404).json({
  //   status: 'fail',
  //   message: `Can't find ${req.originalUrl} on this server!`,
  // });
  // This error is also handle in other files like tourController.js so we want to handle this error in a central middleware.

  // const err = new Error(`Can't find ${req.originalUrl} on this server`);
  // err.status = 'fail';
  // err.statusCode = 404;

  // if the next function receives an arugment, no matter what it is, Express will automatically know that there was an error
  // it will therefore jump to the error handling middleware
  // next(err);

  next(new AppError(`Can't find ${req.originalUrl} on this server`, 404));
